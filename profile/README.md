# Umbraco World

Umbraco world is a collection of all things Umbraco community.

The project is fully open source from the outset, as there is a lot of complex learnings to be done and this shall all be done in public.

## What is Umbraco World?
Umbraco world is a solution to a problem in the Umbraco community; the community is filled with an abundance of great resources and sites but there isn't really a central place that fulfills the potential of the community. Umbraco World solves this by aggregating all things Umbraco and making it the clear and obvious place to explore the community in depth, in a simple and accessible way.

## Open source?
Of course. The whole project will always be open source and will always be made up of community members, the project is endorsed by Umbraco but they have no ownership.

The plans of how to manage ownership and maintainers is always up for discussion and review, currently there is two organistaion members but the desire is to grow this and have the whole project steered by the product consumers rather than the product owners. We will review the structure of the organisation frequently, doing so in a  regular cadence we ensure that the product ownership remains aligned with consumer needs.

## How do I help?
However you can! Whilst in its infancy we are trying to establish the best method of communicating what needs to be done and how you can help, but talking/discussions are always welcome. You can reach out by twitter, issues or even in the Discord! This may be updated when we discover the best way of achieving it, but if you have an idea or know of a great open source project that does it well - get in touch! 

## Is it free?
Yes! It is free and has no intention of being anything but. We would welcome sponsors and donations in order for the costs to be covered and will publicly display "the books" as frequently as possible ensuring that the whole thing from the outset is transparent.
